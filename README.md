# math-billiards

Included is a Jupyter Notebook containing my code to investigate the classic problem of mathematical billiards. The notebook also explains the mathematical background of my approach as well as some animations to clearly outline the points made. 

It's recommended to download the notebook and read/run each cell one-by-one. As the user gets to grips with the content, they will be able to start creating their own billiard systems and investigate the emergence of chaos. 

The notebook was submitted as part of my undergraduate degree for the University of Birmingham School of Physics and Astronomy.

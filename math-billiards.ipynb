    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will aim to investigate the game of mathematical billiards, in which a billiard ball is treated as a point particle, travelling on a frictionless 'table' with no dissipation. The entire trajectory of the ball can, in principle, be determined solely by its initial position and its initial velocity (or simply initial direction) within a given set of boundaries for the table. The phase spaces formed by the trajectories will be examined, and concepts such as chaos and ergodicity will be explored in the context of billiard trajectories. "

    "## Background and general approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is characterised by its boundaries. Within this project, only horizontal, vertical, circular (semi-circular) and elliptical boundaries will be considered. All reflections are characterised by the same simple rule: angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical problem occurs in two dimensions, so the approach taken will be to plot each trajectory on the xy-plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways in which one could go about generating trajectories. The first would be to initialise the ball and step it forward in time by some small step, measuring when it collides with the boundary. The other approach would be to view the trajectory as a series of line segments, each one dependent on the last. The latter approach is the one that this project chooses to adopt, as it uses mathematical analysis to determine accurate plots rather than simply using brute force. Generating equally precise plots with the former method will likely be much less computationally efficient. Furthermore, functionality for generating intermediate points (points between where the ball intersects the boundary), spaced according to the user's choice, is provided in the code below. This means that there is little disadvantage in terms of possible use of these points for analysis or generating animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameterisation is used to characterise the next line segment the ball will travel along until it hits another boundary:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{init} \\\\ y_{init} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\\\ v_1 \\end{pmatrix}t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  $x_{init}$ and $y_{init}$ correspond to the coordinates of a known initial point; $v_0$ and $v_1$ are the components of the already calculated direction vector $\\textbf{v}$ for this line segment and $t$ is some parameter. The code will solve for t on each piecewise part of the boundary, according to the specific equation that characterises that part of the boundary, and reflect the ball off of the boundary for which the t solution is the smallest. The parameter $t$ corresponds to some measure of time - negative $t$ corresponds to the ball travelling backwards in time along the prescribed trajectory. As such, solutions which give negative (and zero) t will be discounted. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{v}$ can be physically interpreted as the ball's velocity along each particular line segment, which will be kept normalised throughout as there is no dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the techniques used to generate intersection points are analytic, the computer is constrained to rounding errors, which may cause the trajectories to slightly deviate from what they should theoretically be. This effect may be accentuated over many collisions, especially within tables that produce chaotic behaviours. "

    "## Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most interesting part of analysing the game of mathematical billiards is the close relation the problem has to chaos theory. The problem provides an intuitive framework for understanding some of the basics of chaos theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Phase space will become an important tool when analysing chaotic plots. In the context of mathematical billiards, although it is possible, in principle, to reduce phase space to two dimensions, an intuitive understanding of the problem can be obtained by considering a three dimensional phase space. The coordinates of a point in phase space will be determined by the x and y position of the ball, as well as theta - defined as the angle the direction vector makes with the x-axis at that point. Since three-dimensional phase space is unclear when viewed on a two-dimensional screen, it may often be more useful to look at two dimensional projections of the phase space. The phase space of a trajectory will help to understand whether a table produces chaotic or regular (non-chaotic) behaviour$^1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaos can be understood as extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. In other words, changing the initial conditions of the trajectory, even by a very small amount, should quickly lead to diverging trajectories. Another feature of chaotic behaviour is non-periodicity. A chaotic billiard table may have possible trajectories that are periodic. However, such trajectories are repelling, meaning that however close a ball gets to a point in phase space containing this periodic trajectory, the ball in fact diverges from the periodic trajectory, rather than being attracted to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of ergodicity also becomes important when analysing trajectories and whether the are chaotic. In the context of a dynamical system, such as a chaotic billiard table, to say that the trajectory is ergodic means that the ball does not concentrate into particular areas of the phase space more than others$^2$. Many chaotic systems display ergodicity, including some of the billiard trajectories to be found below. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, it will be easy to tell that a trajectory is regular by whether it produces some visible pattern. Examining the phase space of the trajectories will give a clearer indication as to whether the dynamics of a specific billiard are chaotic or regular. "

    "\n",
    "Billiard tables appear as natural analogies to many problems in physics, especially in optics and acoustics. In the context of statistical physics, the Boltzmann gas of elastically colliding particles in a box can be easily reduced to a corresponding billiard problem. Understanding the concept of ergodicity is also extremely important in statistical physics.  "

    "The complete set of table boundaries will be a collection of individual boundaries, each with their own specific categories. Straight lines must either fall into the 'horizontal' or 'vertical' categories, whilst categories of 'circle', 'ellipse', 'semi-circle left' and 'semi-circle right' are also supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The collide() method  will change the direction vector inputted according to the type of boundary, and where on the boundary the ball hits. Collisions with horizontal and vertical boundaries are the easiest to understand, as they just correspond to multiplying the y and x components of the direction vector, respectively, by $-1$. Collisions with curved boundaries are more difficult to code for. The approach taken is to consider the collision as a reflection across the normal at the boundary. This is done by taking a small step back in time along the previous line segment (this small step is controlled by the small_step variable), and reflecting this point across the normal at the boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of the normal for a circle centred at the origin at a point on the boundary, $ (x_{boundary}, y_{boundary}) $ is simply $ y = mx $ where the gradient, $m$, is given by $ m = y_{boundary}/x_{boundary} $. (This can be easily translated for circles that are not centred at the origin).\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the equation of the normal for an ellipse centred at the origin at a point on the boundary, the parameterisation $ x = a\\cos(p), y = p\\sin(p) $ may be used, where $p$ is some parameter that varies between $0$ and $2\\pi$, and $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse respectively (it is assumed $a \\geq b$, with $a=b$ corresponding to a circle). The equation for the normal at a boundary point with a certain $p$ is then given by $ ax\\sec(p) - by\\csc(p) = a^2 - b^2 $. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the gradients ($m$) and y-intercepts ($c$) of the normals are calculated, the following known transformation matrix for reflection along the line $y = mx + c$ is used (this is a known result in linear algebra):\n",

    "In order to find the value of the parameter $t$ at which the ball hits the boundary, the find_t() class method is used. All negative values of t are to be ignored, so if negative values are obtained, t is set to infinity, which will be equivalent to the ball never hitting the boundary.\n",
